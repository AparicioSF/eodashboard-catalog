  "Title": "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)",
  "Description": "**Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)**\n \nNDVI is a key indicator used in remote sensing to measure vegetation health. It works by comparing how plants reflect light in two specific spectral bands: near-infrared (NIR) and red light. The NDVI formula Which uses the difference between near-infrared (NIR) and red reflectance divided by their sum (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red).\n\n**** Interpreting NDVI**** \nNDVI values range from -1 to 1. Healthy and denser vegetation reflects more NIR and absorbs more red: meaning it has **higher NDVI values**, while bare soil, water, or unhealthy vegetation have **lower NDVI values**.\n\nNDVI was calculated using MODIS/Terra+Aqua BRDF/Albedo Nadir Reflectance products, specifically using the Red and NIR bands, then aggregated into 8-day means at 0.25Â° spatial resolution.",
